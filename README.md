# Backend Engineering Challenge

Welcome to my resolution of the Engineering Challenge

## How to run

To run the code you only need to have the "event.json" and "unbabel_cli.py" files and run the following command through a terminal: "python3 unbabel_cli.py --input_file events.json --window_size 10"

## Notes

It was developer using macOS Sonoma and the python version 3.12.1

## Challenge Objective

Your mission is to build a simple command line application that parses a stream of events and produces an aggregated output. In this case, we're interested in calculating, for every minute, a moving average of the translation delivery time for the last X minutes.

If we want to count, for each minute, the moving average delivery time of all translations for the past 10 minutes we would call your application like (feel free to name it anything you like!).

	unbabel_cli --input_file events.json --window_size 10
	
The input file format would be something like:

	{"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:11:08.509654","translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75aa5","source_language": "en","target_language": "fr","client_name": "airliberty","event_name": "translation_delivered","nr_words": 30, "duration": 20}
	{"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:15:19.903159","translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75aa4","source_language": "en","target_language": "fr","client_name": "airliberty","event_name": "translation_delivered","nr_words": 30, "duration": 31}
	{"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:23:19.903159","translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75bb3","source_language": "en","target_language": "fr","client_name": "taxi-eats","event_name": "translation_delivered","nr_words": 100, "duration": 54}

Assume that the lines in the input are ordered by the `timestamp` key, from lower (oldest) to higher values, just like in the example input above.

The output file would be something in the following format.

```
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:11:00", "average_delivery_time": 0}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:12:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:13:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:14:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:15:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:16:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:17:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:18:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:19:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:20:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:21:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:22:00", "average_delivery_time": 31}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:23:00", "average_delivery_time": 31}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:24:00", "average_delivery_time": 42.5}
